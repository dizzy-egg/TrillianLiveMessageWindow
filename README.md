## Credits

This skin was originally developed and released by Trillian forum user Scream81. The forum post, which is no longer available, was located at http://forums.ceruleanstudios.com/showthread.php?t=105070

Modified to support Trillian's "Mobile" status (changing the avatar border to blue when the user is on mobile).

With thanks to the Trillian developers for continuing support of Trillian 5 skins (and theming in general) in version 6 onwards.
